= Working with NERD_tree

Installing NERD_tree involved cloning the git respository, found at https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree, (clone it directly into the bundles directory, though it is there now), then running ':helptags .'.  The trailing dot is needed because helptags needs an argument of the directory in which to search for building the new help tags.  Having done that, it was then possible to run ':help NERD_tree.txt'
